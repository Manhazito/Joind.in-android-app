Small todo list. Also see @TODO tags in source for more todo's.

v1:
[ ] Unit testing of our classes 
[ ] Incorrect comment counts when votes or privates are present.
[ ] Votes are not really comments?
[X] All strings should be placed into resources so we can easily adapt new languages.
[ ] Layouts could be better. Now it's a complete mess of tables, linears and absolute layouts.
[ ] Naming of id (android:id) could be better.
[ ] Probably a lot of bugfixes.
[ ] The "star" rating sucks.. Can't find a decent rating-bar in android so i use a dropdown for the time being. Should change.

v2:
[ ] Add image thumbnail to event (?).
[ ] Change all layout ID's into correct stuff.
[ ] Check why creating a list is sooooo very slow (inflate, cannot help?).
[ ] Display own comments only.
[ ] Add new features from joind.in API
